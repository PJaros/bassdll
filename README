COMPONENTS
bassdll - the sound engine
demos/core2 - A three-channel sample song using the engine.

INSTALLING/COMPILE

The "bassdll" folder needs to  be moved into the "libraries" folder for your Arduino install.  On my Mac this is inside the Arduino.app package in /Applications.  Your mileage may vary.
